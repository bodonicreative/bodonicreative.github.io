    <h2>Hey!</h2>
    <p>Innovative Design is a family of designers, photographers, web developers, and videographers at the University of California, Berkeley. We are creative individuals who are continuously evolving by collaborating, inspiring and educating one another. It is through our different artistic tools and talents that we are able to create novel photographs, designs, videos, and websites for our peers and professional clients.</p>
    <p>For design requests, please submit the form available on the site. Unfortunately, each semester we recieve more requests than we can accept, so please try to send us yours as early as possible! If you have any other questions or concerns for the club, feel free to email us at innovativedesignatcal@gmail.com.</p>
    <p>If you're looking to apply to the club, we have an infosession at the start of every semester for prospective members. After the infosession is over, the application can be found at apply.innovativedesign.club. You can watch the events page for more information on the club infosession once the semester starts.</p>
    <h2>So, what tiers can I apply to?</h2>
    <p>The club has six tiers that students can apply to be a member on: Blue, Gold, Photo, Video, Web and Product. In addition, Innovative Design also has a dedicated marketing tier, which members can apply to after having been in InnoD for at least one semester. Those intereted in leading a tier can apply after serving at least one semester as well. You can read more about each of the individual tiers below.</p>
