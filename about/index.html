    <h2>Hey!</h2>
    <p>Bodoni Creative is a family of designers, photographers, and web developers at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. We are creative individuals who are continuously evolving by collaborating, inspiring and educating one another. It is through our different artistic tools and talents that we are able to create novel photographs, designs, videos, and websites for our peers and professional clients.</p>
    <p>For design requests, please submit the form available on the site. Unfortunately, each semester we recieve more requests than we can accept, so please try to send us yours as early as possible! If you have any other questions or concerns for the club, feel free to email us at bodonicreative@gmail.com.</p>
    <p>If you're looking to apply to the club, we have an infosession at the start of every semester for prospective members. After the infosession is over, the application can be found (not yet lol) at <a href='http://www.bodonicreative.com/apply'>bodonicreative.com/apply</a>. You can watch the events page (as yet nonexistent) for more information on the club info session once the semester starts.</p>
